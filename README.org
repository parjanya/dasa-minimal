This is a /very painfully minimal/ working example for using websockets on Common Lisp, using Fukamachi’s
[[https://github.com/fukamachi/websocket-driver/][websocket-driver]].

Loading it and pointing the browser to the index.htm path, 
=~/common-lisp/dasa/www/index.htm= in my case, should be enough to get it to work.
